## Complete Workflow Pipeline

### **Step 1: Data Download** (`1.download_data.py`)
**Purpose**: Acquire real-world terrain data for Mt. St. Helens area

**Key Features**:
- Downloads high-resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model) from USGS National Map API
- Processes GPX trail data (Monitor Ridge Route)  
- Calculates optimal bounding boxes around trail with margins
- Downloads landcover data from National Land Cover Database
- **Output**: Raw elevation and landcover GeoTIFF files in `data/raw/`

**Technical Details**:
- Target 1m resolution DEM data
- Uses OpenTopography and USGS APIs
- Automatic fallback to lower resolutions if needed
- Geographic coordinate system handling

---

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing** (`2.preprocess_data.py`)
**Purpose**: Transform raw terrain data into physics-ready layers for the RL environment

**Generated Terrain Layers**:
1. **Slope Map**: Calculated in degrees using proper geographic projections
2. **Stability Map**: Combines slope and terrain roughness (0-1 scale)
3. **Topographic Position Index (TPI)**: Identifies ridges, valleys, flat areas
4. **Vegetation Cost**: Movement difficulty based on landcover types
5. **Terrain Difficulty**: Combined physics-based movement cost
6. **RGB Visualization**: Color-coded terrain for rendering
7. **Trail Maps**: Distance maps and coordinate arrays from GPX data

**Physics Modeling**:
- Proper coordinate system transformations
- Ground distance calculations accounting for latitude
- Gaussian smoothing to reduce micro-terrain noise
- Multi-layer terrain analysis for realistic movement costs

### **Step 3: Model Training** (`3.build_and_train.py`)
**Purpose**: Train PPO agent with fixed reward structure to prevent policy collapse

**Key Innovations**:
- **Fixed Reward Structure**: Progress-based rewards instead of proximity-based
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start close to goal, gradually increase difficulty
- **Comprehensive Callbacks**: Real-time progress tracking, success rate monitoring
- **GPX Export**: Automatic trail export for successful episodes
- **Detailed Logging**: Episode details, training progress, CSV logs

**Training Features**:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm
- Custom physics environment integration
- Success rate tracking with curriculum progression
- Real-time tqdm progress bars
- Tensorboard integration for training visualization

---

### **Step 4: Agent Testing** (`4.test_agent.py`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation and behavior analysis of trained agents

**Testing Capabilities**:
- **Policy Collapse Detection**: Identifies stuck or limited-action agents
- **Behavior Analysis**: Action distribution, movement patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Success rates, episode lengths, reward analysis
- **Trajectory Visualization**: Plots agent paths vs. actual trail
- **Diagnostic Reporting**: Detailed agent behavior assessment

**Key Metrics Tracked**:
- Success rate over multiple episodes
- Action diversity (prevents single-action policies)
- Trajectory similarity to real hiking trails
- Energy and health management analysis

## Physics Environment (`physics_hiking_env.py`)

### **Realistic Hiking Physics**:
1. **Movement System**: 8-directional + rest actions
2. **Slip Mechanics**: Realistic slipping on steep/unstable terrain
3. **Energy System**: Energy consumption based on terrain difficulty
4. **Health System**: Damage from falls, slips, and extreme conditions
5. **Step Height Limits**: Can't climb walls or extreme elevation changes
6. **Terrain Constraints**: Impassable areas, slope limits

### **State Representation**:
- Local terrain patch (64x64 pixels)
- Current position, energy, health
- Goal direction (optional for curriculum learning)
- Multi-channel terrain information (slope, stability, vegetation, etc.)

### **Reward Structure (Fixed)**:
- **Goal Reached**: +1000 points
- **Progress Reward**: +10 per meter closer to goal
- **Survival Bonus**: +0.1 per step alive
- **Time Penalty**: -0.01 per step (encourages efficiency)
- **Negative Rewards**: Slipping (-1), blocking (-0.5), resting (-2)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Terrain-Aware-Path-Recommendation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Complete Workflow:**
   ```bash
   python 1.download_data.py      # Download terrain data
   python 2.preprocess_data.py    # Process for RL environment  
   python 3.build_and_train.py    # Train PPO agent with fixed rewards
   python 4.test_agent.py         # Test and analyze agent performance
   ```

## Performance Analysis

The testing script provides detailed analysis:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes reaching the goal
- **Progress Metrics**: How far agents move toward the goal
- **Action Diversity**: Variety of movement strategies used
- **Policy Collapse Detection**: Identifies when agents only use one action
- **Behavioral Diagnosis**: Categorizes agent performance (excellent/good/poor/stuck)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Policy Collapse**: If agents only use one action, retrain with the fixed reward structure
- **Stuck Behavior**: The progress-based rewards should prevent this; check reward implementation
- **No Models Found**: Run `3.build_and_train.py` to create trained models
- **Data Missing**: Ensure `1.download_data.py` and `2.preprocess_data.py` complete successfully
